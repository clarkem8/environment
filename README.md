## environment
Some scripts, shortcuts and vim plugins 

### User install

There are two options for installing this environment:
1. The simplest way to install is to launch a cloudformation stack from 'aws/cf-templates/ec2-instance.yaml' of this repo
2. Launch an ec2 instance and follow the script 'environment/setup/install.sh'. Note that this will require the USER variable to be defined
